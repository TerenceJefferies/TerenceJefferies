# Terence Jefferies - Full Stack Developer

I found software development accidentally as a child, while experimenting with multiple projects at home. Immediately, it caught my attention and has kept it ever since. At no point did I consider it an applicable career option, but instead, explored it as a passion. It ignited an insatiable creative drive.

Throughout my school years I continued to write software in my spare time, experimenting with gaming, websites and desktop applications, it was during this experimentation my teachers and mentors made me aware of the potential career opportunities. My search for job opportunities and experience began here.

For the proceeding 10 years I spent my work and personal time developing my skills through internships, jobs, personal projects and experiments. My various positions introduced me to methods of working and helped develop me into a professional, well-rounded programmer.
